# auto-auction

A CLI program written in C++ using Object Oriented Programming that represents a vehicle auction.
There are 4 main car classes that are sold at the auction (Coupe, Cabrio, Hot-Hatch and SuperSport) all derived from the same parent class 'car'.
The template expo represents the auction itself having the ability to add, remove or sell cars.
